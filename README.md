Developed my portfolio website using React and React Components like React-MDL, Reactstrap. Implemented sending e-mails functionality using NodeJS and NodeMailer 

Youâ€™ll need to have Node 8.16.0 or Node 10.16.0 or later version on your local development machine.

Install the create-react-app using:

npm install -g create-react-app

To create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:

npx create-react-app my-app(Portfolio) or npm init create-react-app my-app or yarn create react-app my-app

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

On the Server End i.e. outside the Portfolio react application: 

Install the following: express, body-parser,nodemailer,nodemon,concurrently.

On the Server End we are using NodeJS and Nodemailer to send an emails automatically when the contact form is being submitted (change the email details mentioned in index.js)
